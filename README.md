quantum-walk-on-graphs
======================

Visual Simulation of Quantum Walk on Graphs

Comments:
Implemented in python.
Required libraries:
  numpy: for linear algebra (eigenvalues and eigenvectors)
  pygame: for graphical visualization (basic drawing routines)
  networkx, matplotlib.pyplot: for drawing graphs

To run:
  python qwalk.py
The output will be a simulation of a continuous-time quantum walk on a path on three vertices.
Change the line 
  A = pathGraph(3)
to run the program on another graph.
